# League Search

Desktop app for searching information about your current League of Legends game. Only apply to EUW. This app is created
initially for one of my friend who plays Lol, but since I can't distribute it so I just put into GitHub just for showcase.
If you want to use it, you got to install python 2.7 and shit, included: pygame, requests, json, multiprocessing. Also I 
used this [script](http://pygame.org/project-GIFImage-1039-.html) to integrate GIF image.
